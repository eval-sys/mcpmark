Share a five-line NBA engagement brief so sports moderators can instantly see which thread is dominating.

**Task Requirements:**

1. Register and log in with username `NBA_DataAnalyst_2024` and password `Research#2024!`.
2. In the `sports` forum (or via the site search for “NBA”), locate the NBA-related post with the highest upvote count you can see. Record its exact title, vote total, comment count, and author username.
3. Count how many distinct NBA-titled posts you reviewed for this summary (at minimum, include the post from step 2) and store that total as `Total_NBA_Posts`.
4. Publish a post titled `Statistical Analysis: NBA Content Engagement on This Forum` in the same forum. Its body must consist solely of the Markdown list below; keep the keys/order/pipes untouched while replacing each `FILL_VALUE` with your numbers:

```
- Total_NBA_Posts|FILL_VALUE
- Top_Title|FILL_VALUE
- Top_Votes|FILL_VALUE
- Top_Comments|FILL_VALUE
- Top_Author|FILL_VALUE
```

This easy edition just reports the leading NBA thread plus the count of posts you reviewed—no deeper profile checks are necessary.
