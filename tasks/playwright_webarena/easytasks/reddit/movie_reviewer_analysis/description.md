Provide a lightweight status report on what’s trending in the movies forum so stakeholders can scan it at a glance.

**Task Requirements:**

1. Register and log in with username `movie_reviewer_2024` and password `movie_reviewer_2024`.
2. On the first page of the `movies` forum, count how many post titles contain any four-digit year (e.g., 1984, 2024) and record the total.
3. Still on that page, find the post with the highest upvote count and record its full title as well as the vote and comment counts shown.
4. Publish a post in the same forum titled `Wonderful Movies Analysis: Community Favorites [2024]`. The body must match the four-line Markdown list below—keep the keys, order, and pipe separators exactly as written while replacing each `FILL_VALUE` with your data:

```
- Total_Year_Posts|FILL_VALUE
- Top_Title|FILL_VALUE
- Top_Upvotes|FILL_VALUE
- Top_Comments|FILL_VALUE
```

No multi-page browsing or special threads are required; this easy task captures just the top signals from the first page.
