Deliver a bite-sized AI community snapshot by capturing two essential metrics and posting them back to the forum.

**Task Requirements:**

1. Register and log in with username `AIDataAnalyst2025` and password `SecurePass123!` so every action is tied to that account.
2. Visit the `deeplearning` forum (page 1 only) and count how many posts are visible; note the exact total.
3. Go to the `MachineLearning` forum, find the post titled `[P] I made a command-line tool that explains your errors using ChatGPT (link in comments)`, and record the vote count shown in the listing.
4. Still in `MachineLearning`, create a post titled `MachineLearning_Extraction` whose body is exactly the two-line Markdown list below (keep the keys and pipe separators untouched, replacing each `FILL_VALUE` with your numbers):

```
- Deeplearning_Post_Count|FILL_VALUE
- ChatGPT_Tool_Vote_Count|FILL_VALUE
```

No searches or multi-page navigation are required—just capture these two data points and report them accurately.
