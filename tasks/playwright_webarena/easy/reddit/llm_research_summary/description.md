Produce a five-line GPT activity bulletin so readers can quickly see how active the MachineLearning forum is.

**Task Requirements:**

1. Register and log in with username `llm_analyst_2024` and password `LLMExpert2024!`.
2. On the first page of the `MachineLearning` forum, count how many post titles contain `GPT`, `ChatGPT`, or `LLM`; record the exact total.
3. From that subset, identify the single post with the highest upvote count and note its full title and vote total.
4. Create a new post titled `LLM Research Summary: GPT Discussions Analysis [2024]` in the same forum. The body must be exactly the Markdown list below with your numbers in place of each `FILL_VALUE` (keep the keys, order, and pipe separator intact):

```
- Total_LLM_Posts|FILL_VALUE
- Top1_Title|FILL_VALUE
- Top1_Upvotes|FILL_VALUE
```

That’s the entire easy version—just report the headline LLM count and the hottest related thread.
