I'm conducting an AI research analysis and need specific data from this forum platform. Please help me gather information about AI discussions and community engagement.

**Task Requirements:**

1. Create a new account with the exact 'AIDataAnalyst2025' and password 'SecurePass123!'

2. After logging in, navigate to the deeplearning forum and count the exact number of posts visible on the first page

3. Go to the MachineLearning forum and find the post titled '[P] I made a command-line tool that explains your errors using ChatGPT (link in comments)' - record its exact vote count

4. Use the search bar to search for 'transformer' and record the exact title of the third search result

5. In the MachineLearning forum, click on the 'Sort by: Hot' button and change it to 'New'. Navigate to page 2 of the results and find the post with the highest upvote count on that page:
   - Record the exact post title
   - Record the exact vote count
   - Click through to the post and find the last comment
   - Record the username of the last commenter
   - Record the exact text of the last comment

6. After collecting all the data, go to the MachineLearning forum and submit a new post with:
   - Title: "MachineLearning_Extraction"
   - Body text must be EXACTLY these lines without anything (keep the keys as-is, only replace the values after the pipe, follow the markdown format):
