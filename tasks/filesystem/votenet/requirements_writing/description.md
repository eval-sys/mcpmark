# VoteNet Task: Create Requirements.txt File

## 📋 Task Description

The VoteNet project is a 3D object detection framework for point clouds. Your task is to create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the necessary Python dependencies for running this codebase.

## 🎯 Task Objectives

1. **Create a requirements.txt file** in the current directory
2. **Include all essential dependencies** needed to run the VoteNet codebase
3. **Ensure the file format is correct** (one dependency per line)
4. **Save the file as `requirements.txt`** in the current working directory
5. **Not just** pip install or conda install, your answer should contain **every necessary dependencies in the hole process of VoteNet**.

## 📝 Requirements

The requirements.txt file should contain Python packages that are necessary for:

- 3D point cloud processing
- Deep learning frameworks
- Computer vision libraries
- Data visualization
- 3D mesh processing
- Network/graph operations

## 💡 Note

- You can examine the codebase structure and README to understand what packages are needed
- The file should be saved as `requirements.txt` in the current directory
- Each dependency should be on a separate line
