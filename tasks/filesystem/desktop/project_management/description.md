   - Inside `learning`, create 2 subdirectories: `progress_tracking` and `resources`
   - Inside `personal`, create 2 subdirectories: `entertainment` and `collections`
2. **Move all the Python files** to `experiments/ml_projects/`:
3. **Move all the CSV files** to `experiments/data_analysis/`:
4. **Only Move learning-related markdown files** to `learning/resources/`:
