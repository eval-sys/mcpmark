# Desktop 2024 Time Extraction Task

Read all the files under current path, extract every time/plan information that clearly indicates 2024, and integrate them into a list and create a file in main directory called `timeline.txt`. Write the timeline in the file in the following format.

## Task Requirements

### Rules

- If a task only shows month without day, use the 1st day of that month
- If a task only shows year without month and day, skip it.
- If a file shows multiple tasks on the same date, count only once per date

### Output Format

Each line format: `file_path:time`

- `file_path`: The file path where this time information appears (**relative to the current path**)
- `time`: Specific time, if it's a time period, write the start time (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Sorting Requirements

Sort by chronological order
