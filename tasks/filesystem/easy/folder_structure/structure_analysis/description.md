# Directory Structure Analysis Task

You need to recursively traverse the entire folder structure under the main directory and count the total number of `.py` files in the entire directory (including all subdirectories).

Write the answer (just a single number) in a file named `structure_analysis.txt` in the main directory (at the same level as the `complex_structure` folder).

You should not change or delete any existed files.

Do not try to use python code.
