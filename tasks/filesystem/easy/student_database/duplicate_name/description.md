Please help me identify any duplicate name from the list of all the 150 students. Do not use python code. You only need to find **any one** duplicate name. Then generate a `namesake.txt` file to record the result in the following format, with only three lines. Note: when recording the name, replace underscores with spaces.

name: xxx
count: xxx
ids: xxx, xxx, ...
