# Legal Document File Reorganization Task

**Overview**

The folder "legal_files/" contains multiple versions of the Stock Purchase Agreement (Preferred_Stock_Purchase_Agreement_v0.txt through Preferred_Stock_Purchase_Agreement_v10.txt).

## Task

Your task is to:

1. Identify the final version of the document among the different versions
2. Create a folder named `final_version` inside the `legal_files/` directory
3. Create an **empty file** with the same name as the final version in the newly created `final_version/` folder
4. Keep the original file in its original location

Note: Due to the large file size, you only need to create an empty file (not copy the content). The filename should remain unchanged in the `final_version/` folder.
