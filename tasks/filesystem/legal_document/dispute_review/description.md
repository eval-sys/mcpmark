# Legal Document Dispute Review Task

**Overview**

The folder "legal_files/" contains all versions (Preferred_Stock_Purchase_Agreement_v0.txt  -- Preferred_Stock_Purchase_Agreement_v10.txt) of the Stock Purchase Agreement for a corporate investment project.

There are comments in it, come from four people:

- **Bill Harvey** (Company CEO)
- **Michelle Jackson** (Investor)
- **David Russel** (Company Counsel)
- **Tony Taylor** (Investor Counsel)

Between v1 and v9, these four people make comments on the clauses. The comment format is `[name:content]`, where:

- `name` is the commenter's name
- `content` is the revision note

**Special Note:** If the name is "All parties", it represents a joint comment from all parties, which counts as one comment but does not count toward any individual's personal comment count.

## Task

Your task is to review these versions and identify all clauses that have been commented in **v5,6,7 (in folder legal_files/)**. Generate a file named `dispute_review.txt` in the main directory. In this file, list each commented clause on a separate line and indicate the number of comments for each clause in the format "Clause number:number of comments". Clause number should be in the format of X.X.
