### Task Description

You are given a directory containing multiple paper files. You have a collection of arXiv papers saved as HTML files in the papers directory, along with a BibTeX file. Your task is to organize the older papers (2023 and earlier) into a structured year-based hierarchy with proper documentation, while leaving newer papers in the original location.

### Task Objectives

1. **Organize by year**: Create a year-based directory structure for papers from 2023 and earlier
2. **Generate documentation**: Create INDEX.md files for each year with paper metadata
3. **Create summary**: Build a master SUMMARY.md file linking to all year indexes

### Detailed Requirements

#### Step 1: Organization
- Create directory structure: `organized/{year}/` where year is extracted from the arXiv ID
  - Example: `1707.06347.html` → `organized/2017/1707.06347.html`
- Move each HTML file from 2023 and earlier to its corresponding year folder, keeping original filenames
- Papers from 2024 onwards (arXiv IDs starting with `24` or `25`) should remain in the original papers directory

#### Step 2: Year Index Files
For each year folder, create an `INDEX.md` file containing:
- A markdown table with three columns: `ArXiv ID | Authors | Local Path`
- Extract authors from `<meta name="citation_author" content="..."/>` tags, keeping only the first 3 authors
- If there are more than 3 authors, list the first 3 followed by "et al."
- Format authors as: "Author1, Author2, Author3" or "Author1, Author2, Author3, et al."
- Local Path should be just the filename (e.g., `1707.06347.html`)
- Sort entries by arXiv ID in ascending order

#### Step 3: Master Summary
Create `organized/SUMMARY.md` with:
- A markdown table with columns: `Year | Paper Count | Index Link`
- Index Link should be a relative markdown link (e.g., `[View Index](2017/INDEX.md)`)
- Sort by year in ascending order
