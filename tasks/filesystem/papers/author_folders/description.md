# Paper Organization Task: Author-Based Paper Categorization

## 📋 Task Description

You are given a directory containing multiple paper files. You have a collection of academic papers in HTML format from arXiv. Your task is to analyze these papers, identify authors who have published multiple papers, and organize them into author-specific folders based on specified criteria.

## 🎯 Task Objectives

### Part 1: Frequent Authors (≥4 papers)
1. **Extract author information** from all HTML papers in the given directory
2. **Identify authors** who appear in 4 or more papers
3. **Create a directory** `frequent_authors` 
4. **Create individual folders** within this directory for each frequent author (lowercase names with underscores)
5. **Copy their papers** to their respective folders

### Part 2: Prolific 2025 Authors (≥3 papers)
1. **Extract publication dates** along with author information
2. **Identify authors** who published 3 or more papers in 2025
3. **Create a directory** `2025_authors` for 2025 authors
4. **Create individual folders** within this directory for each prolific 2025 author (lowercase names with underscores)
5. **Copy their 2025 papers** to their respective folders

## 📝 Expected Output

### Directory Structure:
```
[given_task_folder]/
├── [original HTML files remain untouched]
├── frequent_authors/              # Authors with ≥4 papers total
│   ├── smith_john/
│   │   └── [copied papers]
│   ├── johnson_sarah/
│   │   └── [copied papers]
│   └── ...
└── 2025_authors/                  # Authors with ≥3 papers in 2025
    ├── williams_david/
    │   └── [copied 2025 papers]
    ├── brown_emily/
    │   └── [copied 2025 papers]
    └── ...
```

### Requirements:
- Author folder names should be **lowercase** with underscores replacing spaces/commas (e.g., `smith_john`, `williams_david`)
- Papers should be **copied** (not moved) to preserve originals
- Author extraction should handle various name formats correctly
