# Task: Expert Level Learning Path with Complex Prerequisites

## Objective
Create an Expert Level chapter in the Python Roadmap with sophisticated prerequisite chains that require deep understanding of the existing course structure.

## Requirements

### 1. Create Expert Level Chapter
- **Database**: Chapters database
- **Properties**:
  - Name: `Expert Level`
  - Icon: ðŸŸ£ (purple circle emoji)
  - Must appear after Advanced Level in the database

### 2. Create Bridge Lesson
Create a lesson that bridges advanced and expert content:
- **Title**: `Advanced Foundations Review`
- **Status**: Done
- **Chapter**: Link to Expert Level
- **Parent item**: Link to the lesson that currently has status "In Progress" and contains "Control" in its title
- **Sub-items**: Must link to exactly these three lessons:
  - The lesson with title containing "Decorators"
  - The lesson with title containing "Calling API"
  - The lesson with title containing "Regular Expressions"

### 3. Create Expert Level Lessons
Add exactly 4 expert lessons to the Steps database:

**Lesson 1**: `Metaprogramming and AST Manipulation`
- Status: To Do
- Chapter: Expert Level
- Parent item: Link to "Advanced Foundations Review"
- Date: 2025-09-15

**Lesson 2**: `Async Concurrency Patterns`
- Status: To Do
- Chapter: Expert Level
- Parent item: Link to the lesson titled "Calling API"
- Date: 2025-09-20

**Lesson 3**: `Memory Management and GC Tuning`
- Status: In Progress
- Chapter: Expert Level
- Parent item: Link to "Advanced Foundations Review"
- Sub-item: Must have exactly 2 links:
  - Link to any lesson from "Data Structures" that has status "To Do"
  - Link to the lesson containing "OOP" in its title
- Date: 2025-09-25

**Lesson 4**: `Building Python C Extensions`
- Status: To Do
- Chapter: Expert Level
- Parent item: Link to "Metaprogramming and AST Manipulation"
- Date: 2025-10-01

### 4. Update Existing Lessons
- Change the status of "Decorators" from "To Do" to "Done"
- Add "Async Concurrency Patterns" as a Sub-item to "Error Handling"
- Update "Control Flow" status from "In Progress" to "Done"

### 5. Create Learning Path Notes
Add content to the "Advanced Foundations Review" lesson page:
- **Block 1**: Heading 2 with text `Prerequisites Checklist`
- **Block 2**: Bulleted list with exactly 3 items:
  - `âœ… Advanced Python Features (Decorators, Context Managers)`
  - `âœ… API Integration and Async Basics`
  - `âœ… Pattern Matching and Text Processing`
- **Block 3**: Paragraph with text: `This lesson serves as a checkpoint before entering expert-level content. Ensure you have mastered all prerequisites listed above.`
