## Requirements
1. Find and open the Toronto Guide page in Notion.
2. Locate the *Food* database on that page.
3. Update every tag in the Food database that is currently pink so that it uses a different color of your choice (any non-pink color is fine).
4. Do not modify callouts or tags in the other databases.
