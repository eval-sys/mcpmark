Please migrate expiring assets out of the **IT Inventory** database using the simplified checklist below. Your changes will be verified automatically, so match the details exactly.

---
Task Steps
1. Inside the **IT Trouble Shooting Hub** page, locate the database named **IT Inventory**.
2. Collect every page in **IT Inventory** whose **Status** is **Expired** or **To be returned**.
3. Create a **new full-page database** under the same hub titled **IT Asset Retirement Queue** with exactly these properties (names and types must match):
   • Serial – title  
   • Status – select  
   • Expiration date – date
4. For every item gathered in step 2, create a page in **IT Asset Retirement Queue**, copy over the Serial, Status, and Expiration date values, then archive the original inventory page once the copy is made.
