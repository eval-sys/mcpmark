Hi! In my Team Projects page, please create a five-column table block that lists all tasks meeting either of the following conditions:
	1.	The progress is 50% or less, or
	2.	The task has priority P0 but is not yet completed (i.e., progress not at 100%).

You should query this information from the existing “Projects” database.

In the newly created table, each row should represent one task, and all information should be stored as plain text (not relations, formulas, or linked properties).

In the newly created table:
	•	Each row should represent one task
	•	All fields should be stored as plain text (not relations, formulas, or linked properties)
	•	The table should be sorted by expected end date (End Date) in ascending order, so that the first entry is the one with the earliest end date

The table should include the following headers:
	•	Project
	•	Eng Hours
	•	Progress
	•	Start Date
	•	End Date

Please make sure all relevant tasks are included. Thank you!
