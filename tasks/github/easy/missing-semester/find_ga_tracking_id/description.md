Use the GitHub MCP tools to inspect the `mcpmark-eval/missing-semester` repository.

1. Determine the Analytics tracking ID that the Missing Semester site declares in its configuration.
2. Create an `ANSWER.md` file in the repository root that contains exactly:

```
Analytics Tracking ID: <value you found>
```

3. Commit the new file and push the change to `master`.
