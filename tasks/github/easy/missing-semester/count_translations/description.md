Use the GitHub MCP tools to inspect the `mcpmark-eval/missing-semester` repository.

1. Navigate the repository to find the list of community translations that appears on the site's home page.
2. Determine how many translation links are currently listed.
3. Record both the count and the specific file you used as evidence by creating an `ANSWER.md` file in the repository root that contains exactly:

```
Translation Count: <number>
Source: <filename>
```

4. Commit the new file and push the change to `master`.
